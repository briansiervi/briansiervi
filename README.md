# Presentation

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @briansiervi.
- ðŸ‘€ I'm already full stack in C# but I'm looking to improve my JavaScript and TypeScript skills so that I can build websites purely in these languages, using React.js and Node.js.
- ðŸŒ± I am a technical leader during business hours and at the same time I am improving my knowledge in react at [RocketSeat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/).
- :mortar_board: I have a degree in computer science from the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF) and a postgraduate degree in business management from the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP).
- :house_with_garden: I live in Sao Paulo (Brazil).
- ðŸ“« If you are curious to know me, you can find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/briansiervi/).
